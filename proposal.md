# Final project proposal

## Understanding the prevalence of wind turbine development and its impact on energy-widlife interactions
### Sarah Tang
The goal of this project is to better understand the general trend of wind turbine development overtime and by location. As land use needed for wind energy increases, it is crucial to understand the impact of wind turbine development on animals' responses and wildlife habitat.

## Questions & Analysis
1. Where are wind trubines most prevalent within the United States by state? What is common about these states?
2. What is the general trend of wind turbine development over time? Is this correlated with overall wind turbine capacity?
3. Who are wind turbines benefitting? Who is living in areas with wind turbines in terms of socioeconomic class and other metrics?

## Data

Please prepare a short proposal on your final project idea for next **Friday, Nov 2**. The proposal should include:

- Title & description of the project
- Your name & partner's name
- A description of the data required, and how it will be obtained (e.g. URL/DOI to data source)

*You may choose to work with your partner or independently on the final project. Please indicate which clearly in your proposal.*

Replicating results of an existing study and exploring the impact of alternative assumptions in the data preparation, statistical methods chosen etc can provide an excellent template for an analysis (you'll see more of this in units 3 & 4)


Please create your proposal in a markdown file called `proposal.md` in the root directory of the final project repo.  


## Preliminary Rubric (additional areas will be added)

### Project questions must illustrate all of the following tasks:

- Some form of data access / reading into R
- Data tidying preparation
- Initial data visualization
- Use of GitHub
- Reproducible execution with use of Travis
- RMarkdown writeup, with final submission as a nicely formatted PDF document that includes code and results.
- Overall clean and clear presentation of repository, code, and explanations.

### and at least three of the following skills (this list may be modified/extended):

- Use of at least 5 `dplyr` verbs / functions
- Writing / working with custom R functions
- Creating an R package for functions used in the analysis
- Interaction with an API
- Use of regular expressions
- Use of an external relational database
- Preparing processed data for archiving / publication
- Parsing extensible data formats (JSON, XML)
- Use of spatial vector data (`sf` package) and visualization of spatial data
- Creation of an R package
