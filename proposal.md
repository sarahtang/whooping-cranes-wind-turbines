# Final project proposal

## Understanding the prevalence of wind turbine development and its impact on energy-widlife interactions of Grus americana
### Sarah Tang
The goal of this project is to better understand the general trend of wind turbine development overtime and by location. As land use needed for wind energy increases, it is crucial to understand the impact of wind turbine development on animals' responses and wildlife habitat.

One specific example is the whooping crane (Grus americana), one of the most endangered birds in North America. However, it is unclear how whooping cranes will react to wind turbines.

## Questions & Analysis
1. Where are wind turbines most prevalent within the United States by state? What is common about these states?
2. What is the general trend of wind turbine development over time? Is this correlated with overall wind turbine capacity?
3. Are there overlaps in the location of wind turbine sites and the whooping crane migratory patterns?
4. Is there a correlation between the states where wind turbines and whooping cranes are most prevalent?
5. What is the wind turbine implementation policy in such states?

## Data
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides free access to the United States Wind Turbine Database which gives the locations of both land-based and offshore wind turbines in the United States, wind project information, and turbine technical specifications. The USWTDB can be downloaded as a shapefile and in CSV format. (Source: https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/data/, https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/817/)

Whooping crane migration corridor data and precision estimates can be found here (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a314a72e4b08e6a89d707e0), provided by USGS. Additionally, this .csv file includes the locations within the migration corridor (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5a0c6f50e4b09af898cd3fcd).

## Preliminary Rubric (additional areas will be added)

### Project questions must illustrate all of the following tasks:

- Some form of data access / reading into R
- Data tidying preparation
- Initial data visualization
- Use of GitHub
- Reproducible execution with use of Travis
- RMarkdown writeup, with final submission as a nicely formatted PDF document that includes code and results.
- Overall clean and clear presentation of repository, code, and explanations.

### and at least three of the following skills (this list may be modified/extended):

- Use of at least 5 `dplyr` verbs / functions
- Writing / working with custom R functions
- Creating an R package for functions used in the analysis
- Interaction with an API
- Use of regular expressions
- Use of an external relational database
- Preparing processed data for archiving / publication
- Parsing extensible data formats (JSON, XML)
- Use of spatial vector data (`sf` package) and visualization of spatial data
- Creation of an R package
